# 05-Work-Day-Scheduler


## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to create a work day schedule application that stores events that are added by the hour. This application also features efficient local storage management and time-tracking functionality.

## Features
- Responsive design
- Dynamic JavaScript and HTML
- Local storage management 
- jQuery, Moment.js libraries utilized



## Insights
While completing this project, I learned a lot about how to use the Moment.js library and its many different uses in JavaScript. I also developed a deeper understanding of jQuery and its ability to tighten up my code without sacrificing functionality or readability. Additionally, I used JavaScript events to create a dynamic page, and client-side storage to save the events that the client inputs.
